# Python Basics – Day 3 (Lists & Tuples)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 3 Python practice work**, focused on understanding **lists and tuples** in Python.  
The goal of this day was to learn how Python handles **collections of data** and how to access and modify them using basic operations.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- Lists  
- List indexing and slicing  
- Common list operations  
- Tuples  
- Tuple immutability  


## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ List Basics
- Created a list of 5 numbers  
- Printed:
  - The complete list  
  - First element  
  - Last element  
  - Length of the list  

---

### 2️⃣ List Operations
- Added a new element to the list  
- Removed an element from the list  
- Sorted the list  
- Printed the updated list  


### 3️⃣ Tuple Basics
- Created a tuple with 5 elements  
- Printed:
  - The complete tuple  
  - First element  
  - Last element  
  - Length of the tuple  
- Observed that tuple elements cannot be modified (immutability)
